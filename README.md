Experimentation with carcini.com for jekyll/org-mode integration prior to any development on Hot Surface.

Currently:
- Getting basic git integration
- Looking into magit
- Trying to ssh into the server
- Doing tutorials on Jekyll
- Figuring out how to do themes and contemplating how I would setup the site
